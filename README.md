# Unicycle

Named after Propellerhead ReCycle, used as a batch tool to quickly slice audio samples into attack/sustainloop/release parts. It's intended to be used on multiple audiosamples with the same inherent timing, cuts and loop zones then get only defined once and are rendered out for all files. Can also be used to batch-cut legato-samples for authentic note transitions.
